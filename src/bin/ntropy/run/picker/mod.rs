//! The interactive fuzzy picker (ADR 0027, ADR 0036).
//!
//! ntropy renders its own picker over the `nucleo` matcher and `crossterm`
//! rather than a picker library, so the selection bar adapts to any terminal
//! theme (it uses reverse video instead of a hardcoded background) and the
//! whole UI stays under our control. It draws on the controlling terminal,
//! keeping stdout free for piped data (ADR 0036). The public surface is the
//! single generic [`pick`] function; everything else is private, so swapping
//! the engine never touches call sites.
//!
//! All interaction logic lives in [`state::PickerState`] and is unit tested
//! without a TTY (ADR 0021). This module is the thin glue that maps `crossterm`
//! key events onto that state and draws it. Each frame is buffered and reaches
//! the terminal as a single write bracketed by a synchronized update (DEC
//! mode 2026), erases per line rather than clearing the screen, and keeps the
//! cursor hidden until it is parked at the prompt, so redraws neither flicker
//! nor leave cursor trails.
